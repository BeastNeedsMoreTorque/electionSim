"I use play 2.0.4 and I use an external jar, I created a lib folder inside the project, added the
jar in this folder,
run 'eclipsify' command and refresh the project in eclipse and I don't have problem.

is your lib at the same level as app, conf, and tests?
Yes, the lib folder has same level as app, conf and tests. I just try, it works"

Maybe also in Intellij
You can go to Project Structure Under Project Setting -> Modules -> Go to tab Dependencies ,
under sbt-unmanaged-jars you can edit and add your lib manually.
